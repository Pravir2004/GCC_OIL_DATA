# GCC_OIL_DATA_ANALYSIS
To provide a comprehensive analysis of the oil market in the Gulf countries, focusing on export patterns, revenue utilization, and tax generation.
Overview of this project:
1.	Project Title: Gulf Countries Oil Market Analysis
2.	Objective: To provide a comprehensive analysis of the oil market in the Gulf countries, focusing on export patterns, revenue utilization, and tax generation.
3.	Data: Utilizes three primary datasets stored in CSV files, each providing unique insights into the oil market.
4.	Python Code: Employs Python for data analysis, including data import, cleaning, model building, evaluation, and forecasting.
5.	Predictive Models: Builds Linear Regression models to predict export revenue based on export volume and price per barrel, and to predict tax generated based on tax rate per year.
6.	Model Evaluation: Prints the predicted and actual values of the export revenue for comparison, providing an evaluation of the model’s performance.
7.	Visualizations: Generates various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and time series plots to aid in interpreting the data and understanding the trends it reveals.
8.	Time Series Analysis: Includes time series analysis to analyze data that is collected over a period of time and visualizes the trends over time.
9.	Forecasting: Uses the ARIMA model to forecast the export volume for future years.
10.	Conclusion: The project provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the Gulf Countries Oil Market, contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics and trends in this crucial sector. The findings of this study have significant implications for policy-making, economic planning, and strategic decision-making in the oil industry. The project serves as a robust tool for analyzing the Gulf Countries Oil Market and can be further extended or modified for other similar studies. The use of predictive models and visualizations enhances the understanding of the data and the trends it reveals. The project is a testament to the power and versatility of Python in handling and analyzing complex datasets. We look forward to uncovering the dynamics of the Gulf oil market through this project.
